# Example Code

**[https://github.com/Loopring/hello_loopring](https://github.com/Loopring/hello_loopring)** contains some simple examples to help you quickly get started using the Loopring APIs. Among them:

- **hash_and_sign/**: Use Python and the *ethsnarks* to calculate the Poseidon hash of any strings; sign and verify EdDSA signatures.
- **trading/**: Submit, read, and cancel orders.
- **offchain_withdrawal/**: Signing and submit off-chain withdrawal requests (coming soon).

We will continue to improve and open source more example code in the future. Stay tuned.
