{"./":{"url":"./","title":"Loopring","keywords":"","body":"Loopring Protocol & Exchange Loopring is the first scalable DEX protocol built with zkRollup for Ethereum. Using Loopring, people can build a high-performance, orderbook-based, decentralized exchanges that do not take custody of users' crypto-assets. Due to the use of zkRollup, a layer-2 scalability solution, Loopring is capable of settling more than 2,000 trades per second on Ethereum 1.0. If you would like to learn more about Loopring's design and technical details, please check out Loopring's official website: https://loopring.org. Loopring Exchange is the first decentralized trading platform built on top of the Loopring protocol. Loopring Exchange is accessible at Loopring.io. The current version of Loopring Exchange is beta2, which uses Loopring version 3.6. Loopring Exchange's contract address on Ethereum mainnet is: 0x0BABA1Ad5bE3a5C0a66E7ac838a129Bf948f1eA4. The address has a permanent ENS as (exchange2.loopring.eth). Technical Advantages Loopring makes sure nobody can misappropriate users' crypto-assets deposited to an exchange. Even under extreme circumstances, such as an exchange's UI stopped functioning, or the exchange's operators are out of reach, users can still claim their rightful assets by providing valid Merkle proofs that are derivable from data on Ethereum. Loopring does not guarantee the efficiency and fairness of off-chain order-matching. Order-matching is a job for the relayer system, which is a centralized piece of the overall DEX solution. Different exchanges built on the same Loopring protocol can adopt very different relayer solutions and thus provide various quality of services. The Loopring protocol does guarantee that relayers must follow specific rules for trade settlement. We developed Loopring Exchange's relayer system as a closed source project. As of now, it offers a throughput of 200 trades per second.. Overall Architecture The overall architecture of Loopring Exchange is shown below: Some key points you need to know: Loopring Exchange provides API to handle user offchain requests, namely order submission and cancellation, and withdrawals. Other user requests, including account registration, password reset, and deposits, must be submitted using Ethereum transactions. These requests are called on-chain requests. Loopring offers a high-performance trading experience similar to centralized exchanges, which mainly benefits from the batch processing capability of the underlying Loopring protocol. Loopring uses Ethereum as a data availability layer and a ZKP verification layer; Loopring does not perform trading related computations on Ethereum.

Off-chain Requests User requests sent to Loopring Exchange using Loopring's API. Base Token The target token to trade. For example, in the LRC-ETH trading pair, LRC is referred to as the base token. Quote Token The token to quote price. For example, in the LRC-ETH trading pair, ETH is referred to as the base token. Size The quantity of the base token in an order or a fill. Volume The quantity of the quote token in an order or a fill. EdDSA The signing algorithm used by Loopring to sign off-chain requests.

"},"basics/key_mgmt.html":{"url":"basics/key_mgmt.html","title":"Key Management","keywords":"","body":"Key Management Before using Loopring's API, you need to know how to obtain and change your account's EdDSA key pair and ApiKey. When invoking the API, the ApiKey needs to be passed to the relayer as an HTTP header value; the EdDSA secret key is used to sign the request on the client-side digitally. Obtain EdDSA key pair and ApiKey First of all, you need to register an account on Loopring Exchange (LoopringV2). Then you can use the \"Export Account\" function to export account-related information as a JSON object. The JSON object includes your EdDSA key pair and your account's ApiKey. The exported JSON should look like the following: { \"exchangeName\": \"LoopringDEX: Beta 1\", \"exchangeAddress\": \"0x944644Ea989Ec64c2Ab9eF341D383cEf586A5777\", \"accountAddress\": \"0xe9577b420d96adfc97ff1e9e0557f8c73d7247fe\", \"accountId\": 12345, \"apiKey\": \"qXJpfTKrF0O5jIDPYIu7YkVgLFbvm5uIgPKBmHP2kBpcdKZjgfFKhIlE8evo9lKa\", \"publicKeyX\": \"0x2cba32a1bdb218aa380c1e42a8d7dcbf345ec9c914ecf37e34006b34260d1981\", \"publicKeyY\": \"0xb02f0e022052972c3f8b25d69e6f289cb8f847063c62840ea880089b2dc096e\", \"privateKey\": \"0x2bf7d29ae0293dd8b7538681341934a26ec5c98bd2f8c58e4d67bbede05d1b7\" } The first four fields are constants to the current version of the Loopring Exchange; other fields are about your account. Among them, publicKeyX andpublicKeyY are collectively the EdDSA public key of your account, and privateKey is the EdDSA private key. Please keep your EdDSA key pair and ApiKey strictly confidential. If you leak these information, your assets will be at risk. In any case, Loopring Exchange's UI and its API will never ask you for your EdDSA private key. Change EdDSA key pair and ApiKey You can change your EdDSA key pair through the \"Change Password\" function on Loopring Exchange. Because changing the password involves an Ethereum transaction and zero-knowledge proof generation, it will take a while for your new EdDSA key pair to becomes effective. You can get account information through the /api/v3/account API. If thefrozen field is true, it means that your account is in the processing of applying the new EdDSA key pair, during such a period, neither your previous EdDSA key pair nor your new EdDSA key pair can be used to sign requests. When you change your password on Loopring.io, your ApiKey will also be automatically updated. You can also change your ApiKey using API. EdDSA Generation The Loopring protocol does not specify how to generate or manage EdDSA key pairs. Loopring Exchange uses each account's Ethereum address and trading password to derive the EdDSA key pair. As Ethereum addresses are public information, the strength of your trading password is thus critical to the security of your trading assets. If you use Loopring Exchange's website to set the trading password, your password should be strong enough not to worry about being brute-forced; otherwise, you need to be careful not to use a simple password. Unlike a centralized exchange, brute-forcing your EdDSA key does not have to go through Loopring relayer - your EdDSA public key is stored on Ethereum, and hackers can read it out for brute force comparison. The algorithm for compute the EdDSA key pair is as follows (Python): seed = keccakHash('LOOPRING' + address.toLowerCase() + keccakHash(password)) keyPair = myEdDSAGenerator.generate(seed) where keccakHash returns the hex string of the kecca256 result. ApiKey Generation ApiKey is a globally unique string randomly generated by the Loopring relayer and bound to your account when your account is registered. "},"basics/signing.html":{"url":"basics/signing.html","title":"Request Signing","keywords":"","body":"Request Signing The Loopring API involves two different categories of signatures. One is the common API request signature, which is used to verify that the API invocations have been authenticated; the other is Loopring Protocol's off-chain request signature, which is used by Loopring to verify that off-chain requests have been authenticated. We will explain each of these two categories separately. Special API Request Signatures Algorithm Initialize signatureBase to an empty string. Append the API's HTTP method to signatureBase. Append '＆' to signatureBase. Append percent-encoded full URL path (without ? or any query parameters) to signatureBase. Append '&' to signatureBase. Initialize parameterString to an empty string. For GET / DELETE requests: Sort query parameters in ascending order lexicographically; Append percent-encoded key name to parameterString; Append an '=' to parameterString; Append percent-encoded value to parameterString; Append a '&' if there are more key value pairs. For POST / PUT requests: Append request body as a string to parameterString. Append percent-encoded parameterString to signatureBase Calculate the SHA-256 hash of signatureBase as hash. Signhash with the private EdDSA key and get Rx, Ry, and S. Concatenate Rx,Ry, andS using ',' as: ${Rx},${Ry},${S}. HTTP Method and URL Please make sure you use only the following HTTP methods, in upper case letters. GET POST PUT DELETE Also make sure the HTTPS header is included and is in lower case. For example: https://api3.loopring.io/api/v3/apiKey Example Actually So far only 2 API need this special EDDSA API signing -- updateApiKey & cancel order, let's see how the signatureBase is contructed. Update user API key For the above url with the following url query parameters: https://api3.loopring.io/api/v3/apiKey?accountId=10005 or Query param Value accountId 10005 parameterString shoule be: accountId=10005 and signatureBase should be: GET&https%3A%2F%2Fapi3.loopring.io%2Fapi%2Fv2%2FapiKey&accountId%3D10005 Cancel Order For the above url with the following url query parameters: https://api3.loopring.io/api/v3/order?accountId=10005&clientOrderId=Sample or Query param Value accountId 10005 clientOrderId Sample parameterString shoule be: accountId=10005&clientOrderId=Sample and signatureBase should be: DELETE&https%3A%2F%2Fapi3.loopring.io%2Fapi%2Fv3%2Forder&accountId%3D10005%26clientOrderId%3DSample Off-chain Request Signatures Loopring 3.6 supports support lots of off-chain requests: orders, order cancellation, swap, join AMM pool, exit AMM pool , transfer and off-chain withdrawals, etc. Since these off-chain requests will result in modifications to the exchange's state Merkel tree, when you submit these types of requests using Loopring's API, sometimes you must provide EXTRA special signatures required by the Loopring protocol. Overview of signatures and requests Below is a signature type table for all those requests, each request asks for different signature methods due to different business models. Request Type eddsaSignature ecdsaSignature approvedHash X-API-SIG submitOrder(AMM swap) Y N N N cancelOrder N N N Special API Request EDDSA Signatures updateApiKey N N N Special API Request EDDSA Signatures joinAmmPool Y Disabled Y N exitAmmPool Y Disabled Y N submitTransfer Y Disabled Y EIP712 signature of request structure submitOffchainWithdraw Y Disabled Y EIP712 signature of request structure updateAccount Y Y Y EIP712 signature of request structure eddsaSignature, ecdsaSignature, approvedHash are located in REST request body. X-API-SIG is located in REST request header. Y means support. N means not support. Disabled means no longer support. We STRONGLY suggest using Level-2 EDDSA key to sign every requests, which saves both time & money of both user and Loopring as no Eth mainnet transaction and the corresponding block confirmation. For more details, please refer to Key Management. Below we take signing order and signing transfer/withdrawal as examples, as you will see, the first one order signing needs merely Level-2 EDDSA signature, but the later two need extra EIP712 signature in request header, you can see the difference on the way of submitting the requests. Signing Orders You need to seralized specific fields of an order into an integer array, then calculate the Poseidon hash of the array, and then sign the hash with your EdDSA private key. The rules for serialization of orders, hashing, and signature methods must strictly follow Loopring's Specification. Below we use Python code as a demo: class EddsaSignHelper: def __init__(self, poseidon_params, private_key): self.poseidon_sign_param = poseidon_params self.private_key = private_key # print(f\"self.private_key = {self.private_key}\") def hash(self, structure_data): serialized_data = self.serialize_data(structure_data) msgHash = poseidon(serialized_data, self.poseidon_sign_param) return msgHash def sign(self, structure_data): msgHash = self.hash(structure_data) signedMessage = PoseidonEdDSA.sign(msgHash, FQ(int(self.private_key, 16))) return \"0x\" + \"\".join([ hex(int(signedMessage.sig.R.x))[2:].zfill(64), hex(int(signedMessage.sig.R.y))[2:].zfill(64), hex(int(signedMessage.sig.s))[2:].zfill(64) ]) class OrderEddsaSignHelper(EddsaSignHelper): def __init__(self, private_key): super(OrderEddsaSignHelper, self).__init__( poseidon_params(SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD, 12, 6, 53, b'poseidon', 5, security_target=128), private_key ) def serialize_data(self, order): return [ int(order[\"exchange\"], 16), int(order[\"storageId\"]), int(order[\"accountId\"]), int(order[\"sellToken\"]['tokenId']), int(order[\"buyToken\"]['tokenId']), int(order[\"sellToken\"]['volume']), int(order[\"buyToken\"]['volume']), int(order[\"validUntil\"]), int(order[\"maxFeeBips\"]), int(order[\"fillAmountBOrS\"]), int(order.get(\"taker\", \"0x0\"), 16) ] If you don't use the ethsnarks library to calculate Poseidon hash, please pay attention to the values of the Poseidon parameters to ensure that they are entirely consistent with those used by Loopring. Otherwise, signature verification will fail. Signing Off-chain Withdrawals Following structure shows a offchain withdrawal request: { \"exchange\": \"0x35990C74eB567B3bbEfD2Aa480467b1031b23eD9\", \"accountId\": 5, \"owner\": \"0x23a51c5f860527f971d0587d130c64536256040d\", \"token\": { \"tokenId\": 0, \"volume\": str(1000000000000000000), }, \"maxFee\" : { \"tokenId\": 0, \"volume\": str(1000000000000000), }, \"to\": \"0xc0ff3f78529ab90f765406f7234ce0f2b1ed69ee\", \"onChainDataHash\": \"0x\" + bytes.hex(onchainDataHash), \"storageId\": 5, \"validUntil\" : 0xfffffff, \"minGas\": 300000, \"extraData\": bytes.hex(extraData) } The code for signing it in Python is as follows. Just like the order, the only difference is the request itself, so we just adjust params which calculate the poseidon hash. class WithdrawalEddsaSignHelper(EddsaSignHelper): def __init__(self, private_key): super(WithdrawalEddsaSignHelper, self).__init__( poseidon_params(SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD, 10, 6, 53, b'poseidon', 5, security_target=128), private_key ) def serialize_data(self, withdraw): return [ int(withdraw['exchange'], 16), int(withdraw['accountId']), int(withdraw['token']['tokenId']), int(withdraw['token']['volume']), int(withdraw['maxFee']['tokenId']), int(withdraw['maxFee']['volume']), int(withdraw['onChainDataHash'], 16), int(withdraw['validUntil']), int(withdraw['storageId']), ] Signing Internal Transfer You need to seralized specific fields of an transfer into an integer array, then calculate the Poseidon hash of the array, and then sign the hash with your EdDSA private key. The following is an example of internal transfers: { \"exchange\": \"0x35990C74eB567B3bbEfD2Aa480467b1031b23eD9\", \"payerId\": 0, \"payerAddr\": \"0x611db73454c27e07281d2317aa088f9918321415\", \"payeeId\": 0, \"payeeAddr\": \"0xc0ff3f78529ab90f765406f7234ce0f2b1ed69ee\", \"token\": { \"tokenId\": 0, \"volume\": str(1000000000000000000), }, \"maxFee\" : { \"tokenId\": 0, \"volume\": str(1000000000000000), }, \"storageId\": 1, \"validUntil\": 0xfffffff } where storageId must start from 1 and increment by 2. The code for signing it in Python is as follows: class OriginTransferEddsaSignHelper(EddsaSignHelper): def __init__(self, private_key): super(OriginTransferEddsaSignHelper, self).__init__( poseidon_params(SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD, 13, 6, 53, b'poseidon', 5, security_target=128), private_key ) def serialize_data(self, originTransfer): return [ int(originTransfer['exchange'], 16), int(originTransfer['payerId']), int(originTransfer['payeeId']), # payer_toAccountID int(originTransfer['token']['tokenId']), int(originTransfer['token']['volume']), int(originTransfer['maxFee']['tokenId']), int(originTransfer['maxFee']['volume']), int(originTransfer['payeeAddr'], 16), # payer_to 0, #int(originTransfer.get('dualAuthKeyX', '0'),16), 0, #int(originTransfer.get('dualAuthKeyY', '0'),16), int(originTransfer['validUntil']), int(originTransfer['storageId']) ] Extra ECDSA authentic in header As the above table shows, some requests need extra authentic in request header. Listed as below: Request EDDSA ECDSA Approved Hash X-API-SIG in header submitTransfer Y Optional Y EIP712 signed structure submitOffchainWithdraw Y Optional Y EIP712 signed structure updateAccount Y Y Y EIP712 signed structure So, If a user wants to do submitTransfer, submitOffchainWithdraw and updateAccount, in addition to EDSSA signature, you also need to use ECDSA to sign them and put the signature in request header. Loopring 3.6 uses the EIP712 standard, A user need to serialize specific fields of an request, say transfer into a EIP712 compatible structure, and then use standard EIP712 hash algorithm to calculate the hash of the structure, and then, use personal _sign to sign the combined string. The code for EIP712 signing it in python is as follows: def createOriginTransferMessage(req: dict): class Transfer(EIP712Struct): pass setattr(Transfer, 'from', Address()) Transfer.to = Address() Transfer.tokenID = Uint(16) Transfer.amount = Uint(96) Transfer.feeTokenID = Uint(16) Transfer.maxFee = Uint(96) Transfer.validUntil = Uint(32) Transfer.storageID = Uint(32) transfer = Transfer(**{ \"from\" : req['payerAddr'], \"to\" : req['payeeAddr'], \"tokenID\" : req['token']['tokenId'], \"amount\" : int(req['token']['volume']), \"feeTokenID\" : req['maxFee']['tokenId'], \"maxFee\" : int(req['maxFee']['volume']), \"validUntil\" : req['validUntil'], \"storageID\" : req['storageId'] }) # print(f\"transfer type hash = {bytes.hex(transfer.type_hash())}\") return EIP712.hash_packed( EIP712.exchangeDomain.hash_struct(), transfer.hash_struct() ) message = createUpdateAccountMessage(transfer_request) v, r, s = sig_utils.ecsign(message, self.ecdsaKey) The EIP712 structure declarations of each requests types can be found in Loopring contract, or just get it from our reference code base. Below are withdrawal request EIP712 structure. struct Withdrawal { address owner; uint32 accountID; uint16 tokenID; uint amount; uint16 feeTokenID; uint fee; address to; bytes32 extraDataHash; uint minGas; uint32 validUntil; uint32 storageID; } So the signing logic is: def createOffchainWithdrawalMessage(req: dict): class Withdrawal(EIP712Struct): owner = Address() accountID = Uint(32) tokenID = Uint(16) amount = Uint(96) feeTokenID = Uint(16) maxFee = Uint(96) to = Address() extraData = Bytes() minGas = Uint() validUntil = Uint(32) storageID = Uint(32) # \"Withdrawal(address owner,uint32 accountID,uint16 tokenID,uint96 amount,uint16 feeTokenID,uint96 maxFee,address to,bytes extraData,uint256 minGas,uint32 validUntil,uint32 storageID)\" withdrawal = Withdrawal(**{ \"owner\" : req['owner'], \"accountID\" : req['accountId'], \"tokenID\" : req['token']['tokenId'], \"amount\" : int(req['token']['volume']), \"feeTokenID\" : req['maxFee']['tokenId'], \"maxFee\" : int(req['maxFee']['volume']), \"to\" : req['to'], \"extraData\" : bytes.fromhex(req['extraData']), \"minGas\" : int(req['minGas']), \"validUntil\" : req['validUntil'], \"storageID\" : req['storageId'], }) # print(f\"extraData hash = {bytes.hex(Web3.keccak(bytes.fromhex(req['extraData'])))}\") # print(f\"withdrawal type hash = {bytes.hex(withdrawal.type_hash())}\") return EIP712.hash_packed( EIP712.exchangeDomain.hash_struct(), withdrawal.hash_struct() ) message = createUpdateAccountMessage(withdrawal_request) v, r, s = sig_utils.ecsign(message, self.ecdsaKey) Please NOTE: The final string in request header is a 134 bytes hex string which is constructed as below code shows: v, r, s = sig_utils.ecsign(message, self.ecdsaKey) header['X-API-SIG'] = \"0x\" + bytes.hex(v_r_s_to_signature(v, r, s)) + \"02\" It starts with '0x' to indicate hex format and ends with '02' which stands for EIP_712 signature type. Forget to add '02' type leads to signature verification failure as Relay has no hint on the way of verifiction.

"},"basics/orders.html":{"url":"basics/orders.html","title":"Orders","keywords":"","body":"Orders Uni-Directional Order Model Unlike the order models of most centralized exchanges, Loopring uses the Uni-Directional Order Model (UDOM). UDOM represents buy orders and sell orders uniformly with one single data structure. Let's start with a simplified UDOM model to give you a few examples of Loopring's limit price orders (Loopring doesn't support market price orders). In the LRC-ETH trading pair, a sell order that sells 500 LRC at the price of 0.03ETH/LRC can be expressed as: { // LRC-ETH: sell 500 LRC at 0.03ETH/LRC \"sellToken\": { \"token\" : \"LRC\", \"volume\" : 500 }, \"buyToken\": { \"token\" : \"ETH\", \"volume\" : 15 } } a buy order that buys 500 LRC at the price of 0.03ETH/LRC can be expressed as: { // LRC-ETH: buy 500 LRC at 0.03ETH/LRC \"sellToken\": { \"token\" : \"ETH\", \"volume\" : 15 }, \"buyToken\": { \"token\" : \"LRC\", \"volume\" : 500 } } As you may have noticed, UDOM does not specify trading pairs or prices explicitly. However, there is a problem with this simplified model: the match-engine doesn't know when an order should be considered as fully filled. We need to introduce another parameter called buy for this purpose. If buy == true, the match-engine shall check the total fill amount of tokenB against amountB to determine if an order has been fully filled; otherwise, it shall use the total fill amount of tokenS against amountS. With this new field, the above orders will look like the following: { // LRC-ETH: sell 500 LRC at 0.03ETH/LRC \"sellToken\": { \"token\" : \"LRC\", \"volume\" : 500 }, \"buyToken\": { \"token\" : \"ETH\", \"volume\" : 15 }, // = 500 * 0.03, \"fillAmountBOrS\": false // check sell token's fill amount against [\"sellToken\"][\"volume\"] } { // LRC-ETH: buy 500 LRC at 0.03ETH/LRC \"sellToken\": { \"token\" : \"ETH\", \"volume\" : 15 }, // = 500 * 0.03, \"buyToken\": { \"token\" : \"LRC\", \"volume\" : 500 } \"fillAmountBOrS\": true // check buy token's fill amount against [\"buyToken\"][\"volume\"] } Note: If the above sell order is fully filled, the amount of ETH bought may be larger than 15ETH; and if the buy order is fully filled, the ETH paid may be less than 15ETH, which is the impact of the fillAmountBOrS parameter on the match engine's behaviors. What is the effect of reversing the fillAmountBOrS value in the two orders above? The sell order for the LRC-ETH trading pair becomes a buy order for the ETH-LRC trading pair, and the buy order for the LRC-ETH trading pair becomes a sell order for the ETH-LRC trading pair. It means one Loopring trading pair, such as LRC-ETH, is equivalent to two trading pairs in many centralized exchanges, i.e., LRC-ETH and ETH-LRC. Besides its elegancy and simplicity, Loopring's UDOM also makes it possible to implement much simpler settlement logic in ZKP circuits. So far AMM swap order does NOT support fillAmountBOrS, so, please set fillAmountBOrS to false in swap request. Order object Loopring's actual order format is a bit more complex. You can use the following JSON to express a limit price order. For details of specific parameters, see Submit Order. order = { // sign part \"exchange\" : \"0x7489DE8c7C1Ee35101196ec650931D7bef9FdAD2\", \"accountId\" : 10004, \"storageId\" : 0, \"sellToken\": { \"tokenId\": 0, // ETH \"volume\": \"15000000000000000000\" }, \"buyToken\" : { \"tokenId\": 1, // LRC \"volume\": \"500000000000000000000\" }, \"validUntil\" : 1700000000, \"maxFeeBips\" : 50, \"fillAmountBOrS\": true, \"taker\" : \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", // aux data \"allOrNone\" : false, \"clientOrderId\" : \"SampleOrder\", \"orderType\" : \"LIMIT_ORDER\", // \"AMM\", \"MAKER_ONLY\", \"TAKER_ONLY\" \"channelId\" : \"channel1::maker1\" // signature \"eddsaSignature\":\"0x1c31e81cdde3c9f92e31ab35733e3403de45325cb5f90832c9d4f8673ec22f501de9e9b97c8d7b475ab12836d87c9c6f2a78a91cd650bc77ec4079ffd966933f10d6a5c133ee270013f1d8596c706f2623d0ba1c3dccbc3f202db606bb00d6bc\" // 0x + 192 bytes hex string, i.e., 0x+Rx+Ry+s } Next, we will further explain some of these data fields for you. Tokens and Amounts In an actual order, tokens are not expressed by their names or ERC20 addresses, but by their token ID, the index at which the tokens have been registered in the Loopring Exchange's smart contract. Note that the same ERC20 token may have different IDs on different exchanges built on top of the same Loopring protocol. In the above example, we assume that the IDs of LRC and ETH are 1 and 0, respectively. You can query token's information using Token Information Supported by the Exchange. The amounts of tokens are in their smallest unit as strings. Taking LRC as an example, its decimals is 18, so 1.0LRC should be expressed as \" 1000000000000000000 \" (1 followed by 18 0s). Each token's decimals is coded in its smart contract; the decimals of ETH is 18. Trading Fee maxFeeBips = 50 specifies that the maximum trading fee the order is willing to pay to the exchange is 0.5% (the unit of maxFeeBips is 0.01%). Loopring charges trading fees in tokenB as a percentage of the token bought from a trade. Assuming that the order above has bought \"10000000000000000000\" ETH (10ETH), the actual trading fee will not exceed 0.05ETH (\"10000000000000000000\"* 0.5%). Loopring's relayer offers different trading fee discounts based on the user VIP tiers. The bottom line is that the actual trading fees can never exceed the maximum orders are willing to pay, specified by maxFeeBips. When you place an order, you must set maxFeeBips to be no less than the trading fee rate in the specified trading pair for your account (based on your VIP level). This information can be obtained by querying /api/v3/user/feeRates. If you trust Loopring Exchange, you can also set maxFeeBips to 63, the maximum value allowed by the Loopring protocol. Timestamps validUntil specifies the order expiration timestamp, both in seconds since epoch. When the relayer receives an order, it will verify these two timestamps in the order; Loopring's ZKP circuit code will also check these two timestamps during settlement. Due to the delay of zkRollup batch processing, and the possible deviation of the time on Ethereum blockchain and our servers, we strongly recommend that validSince be set to the current time,and the window between validSince andvalidUntil is no shorter than 1 week; otherwise, your order may be rejected or cancelled by the relayer. You can take advantage of the validUntil timestamp to avoid unnecessary proactive cancellation of orders. Fill Status and Storage ID Loopring 3.6 reserves half of 16384 (2142 ^ {14} 2​14​​) slots for each token to track token amounts changs introduced by order and AMM swap order, and the other half slots for each token to track the user's offchain requests include AMM join/exit, transfer and withdraw . If an order's storage ID is N, then the slot used is N % 16384. In other words, if the slot number is m, it will be used to track orders with the following IDs: m, m + 16384, m + 16384 * 2, ... and so on. Each slot also remembers the ID of the current order being tracked (the initial storage ID is the slot number), and subsequent orders with smaller storage IDs will be rejected. Suppose that slot 1 is tracking order 32769 (1 + 16384 * 2). When the user places orders with ID of 1 or16385, the server will reject these orders and return errors. If you have more than 16384 active orders for a trading pair, you need to cancel some of them to release slots before you can submit new orders. Storage IDis the upgraded Order ID of Loopring 3.1, which has big enough capacity, and more usages, See Below table: Storage ID Ranges Count Usages Even numbers {0, 2, 4,...,4294967292， 4294967294} 2147483648 transferwithdrawalAMM joinAMM exit Odd numbers {1, 3, 5,...,4294967293， 4294967295} 2147483648 orderAMM swap order The maximum value of storage ID is 4294967296 (2322^{32}2​32​​). After reaching this ID limit, you can neither place orders nor transfer/withdraw balance on the corresponding token. For most users, this is not a problem, as 4294967296 is big enough, although it is possible that an ultra high-frequent (>100 TPS for all time) trader or transfer payer meet out of ID error. It is worth noting that all sell orders from the same account in multiple trading pairs with the same base token (such as LRC-ETH and LRC-USDT) share the same 16384 slots. If you do not plan to maintain the allocation of storage IDs and slots between trading pairs on the client-side, you can register multiple accounts, as recommended above. We know the inconvenience caused by the slot design. However, this is a design decision made in the Loopring protocol itself. We hope future technological advances can remove this limitation. Other Fields exchange: Unlike Looping 3.1, we now use Loopring Exchange's address as a unique numeric ID in the Looping protocol. accountId: User's account ID. allOrNone: true if the order must be fully filled or cancelled. This parameter is not supported yet by our matching engine, so please set it to \"false\" for now. clientOrderId: Used to label orders by the client without user awareness. It also has no impact on trading. channelId: Used to lable order's channel. For more details, please refer to Submit Order.
